In this manual, we want to guide you in all installation steps of the application, as well as the use by users, and management sections by administrator.


## Installation manual ##

In our system, we have to be installed php5, mysql y apache2. For Symfony installation, we need "composer" application.
Versions used were:

	mySQL 5.5.24
	php 5.4.3
	apache 2.4.2

We can get installation instructions of composer here:

[Composer](http://getcomposer.org/)

Also, php5-xsl and php5-intl extensions are needed to stay loaded:

	[cli]
	sudo apt-get install php5-xsl
	sudo apt-get install php5-intl

First, we need to install our project on server folder. We recommend Git use to perform this action, or copying PFC/repo folder in the new folder.

	[cli]
	git clone [unidad]/PFC/repo/.git directorioDestino

	or

	git clone ssh://git@github.com:arjona00/learning-objects-evaluation-platform.git directorioDestino

	or

	cp -R [unidad]/PFC/repo directorioDestino


Once we are in destination folder, install application. Execute:

	[cli]
	~/composer.phar install

Composer application is usually installed on user's logged home folder.

When vendor download is finished, as shows composer.json file, installation is going to require initial configuration, that will be saved on app/config/parameters.yml file. This configuration includes engine, name, user and password of database.
Now we show usually configuration file:

	[yaml]
    database_driver: pdo_mysql
    database_host: 127.0.0.1
    database_port: null
    database_name: db_pfc
    database_user: root
    database_password: xxxxx
    mailer_transport: smtp
    mailer_host: 127.0.0.1
    mailer_user: null
    mailer_password: null
    locale: en
    secret: ThisTokenIsNotSoSecretChangeIt

If database hasn't been created previously with phpmyadmin or console commands, now we can do it with doctrine commands.

	[cli]
	php app/console doctrine:database:create
	php app/console doctrine:schema:create

Execute data fixtures, that fill database with initial test data. If we want to introduce final subjets data, we can edit src/PFC/ModelBundle/DataFixtures/ORM/LoadsubjetsData.php file.

- arraysubjets: subjets data.

- arraysubjetCategories: categories data.

- arrayCategorySubcategories: subcategories data.

- arrayQuestions: Questions and answers.


	[cli]
	php app/console doctrine:fixture:load

Now that database has been created and filled, we configure restricted access to administration section. Edit app/config/security.yml file.
Here you can find created roles, ROLE_ADMIN y ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN.

	[yaml]
	admin:  { password: XXXX, roles: [ 'ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN' ] }
	profesor1: { password: XXXX, roles: [ 'ROLE_ADMIN' ] }

We need to modify this file and create as many teachers as we wish and/or set passwords.

Symfony use two folders to save cache and logs files, and we have to set the next permissions:

	[cli]
	rm -rf app/logs/*
	rm -rf app/cache/*
	chmod 777 app/logs
	chmod 777 app/cache

Finally, execute asset resources, clear cache and compress resource files. This sequence should be perform when you modify resources as css, js or images.

	[cli]
	php app/console assets:install
	php app/console cache:clear
	php app/console cache:clear --env=prod
	php app/console assetic:dump

Only remains to configure apache's sites and /etc/hosts file in order to point this to our web, located in web folder of application.
